This repository accompanies the paper " **Back-End-of-Line-Compatible Passivation of Sulfur Vacancies in MoS_2 Transistors with Benzenethils** " by Hacksoon Jung, Mingyu Kim, Gi-Beom Sim, Youngwoo Lee, Sumin Hong, Hyeonho Gu, Jaehyun Lee, Donghyeop Lee, Sanghyun Lee, Taoyu Zou, Kibum Kang, Chang-Woo Myung, Yong-Young Noh, and Jimin Kwon.

* ```Data/``` contains inputs and outputs of 1) Geometry relaxation, 2) Density of states, and 3) Improved dimer calculation of MoS2 passivation by the substituted thiolbenzene (TB) molecules (PFBT, 4-ABT, 4-MBT, 4-FBT). Also, contains inputs and outputs of 4) Dipole moment calculations, 5) Electron density, and 6) Molecular electrostatic potential of the TB molecules.
  * To calculate dipole moment, electron density, and molecular electrostatic potential of TB molecules, you can use ```Data/DipoleMoment_MEP/dipole_moment.py```
  * Some outputs were uploaded as compressed (.zip) file type because they data huge. (DOSCAR, density.cube, and mep.cube).
